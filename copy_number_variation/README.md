# Copy Number Variation

This Snakemake pipeline was developed for CNV analysis. It utilizes the [CNVkit](https://cnvkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and also the bam files generated by the [dna-seq-varlociraptor](https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/dna-seq-varlociraptor) pipeline. 

The output from CNVkit is filtered and splited based on the [OncoKB](https://www.oncokb.org/) gene list (oncogene, tumor supressors). 

Gains in oncogenes and losses in tumor suppressor genes are then plotted on oncoprints using the R package [ComplexHeatmap](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ComplexHeatmap.html). 

Additionally, an input file for [GISTIC2.0](https://broadinstitute.github.io/gistic2/) will be created.
